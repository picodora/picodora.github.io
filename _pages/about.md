I am currently a PhD student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en), advised by [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree from UC Davis (2017). Before I joined CISPA, I was a lab manager at [G.O.S.S.I.P](https://gossip.team/).
